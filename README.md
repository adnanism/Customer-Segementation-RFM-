##########What is RFM Analysis?

RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value, each corresponding to some key customer trait. These RFM metrics are important indicators of a customer’s behavior because frequency and monetary value affects a customer’s lifetime value, and recency affects retention, a measure of engagement.


########Why you should do RFM segmentation?

RFM segmentation will make you able to understand your customer base better, and also serve as a good starting point for your data journey and more advanced customer models. You will be able to give more accurate answers to key questions for your business — for example:

Who are your best customers?

Which customers are at the verge of churning?

Who has the potential to be converted in more profitable customers.

Which customer are lost/inactive?

Which customers is critical to retain?

Who are your loyal customers?

Which group of customers is most likely to respond to your current campaign?


#######RFM — The basics.

RMF is a simple statistical method for categorising customers based on their purchasing behaviour. The behaviour is identified by using only three customer data points: the recency of purchase (R), the frequency of purchases (F) and the mean monetary value of each purchase (M). After some calculations on the RFM data we can create customer segments that are actionable and easy to understand — like the ones below:

Champions: Bought recently, buy often and spend the most.

Loyal customers: Buy on a regular basis. Responsive to promotions.

Potential loyalist: Recent customers with average frequency.

Recent customers: Bought most recently, but not often.

Promising: Recent shoppers, but haven’t spent much.

Needs attention: Above average recency, frequency and monetary values. May not have bought very recently though.

About to sleep: Below average recency and frequency. Will lose them if not reactivated.

At risk: Some time since they’ve purchased. Need to bring them back!

Can’t lose them: Used to purchase frequently but haven’t returned for a long time.

Hibernating: Last purchase was long back and low number of orders. May be lost.


#####Designing appropriate campaigns for above Customers.

Champions: Reward them. They can become evangelists and early adopters of new products.

Loyal customers: Up-sell higher value products. Engage them. Ask for reviews.

Potential loyalist: Recommend other products. Engage in loyalty programs.

Recent/new customers: Provide a good onboarding process. Start building the relationship.

Promising: Create more brand awareness. Provide free trials.

Needs attention: Reactivate them. Provide limited time offers. Recommend new products based on purchase history.

About to sleep: Reactivate them. Share valuable resources. Recommend popular products. Offer discounts.

At risk: Send personalised email or other messages to reconnect. Provide good offers and share valuable resources.

Can’t lose them: Win them back. Talk to them. Make them special offers. Make them feel valuable.

Hibernating: Recreate brand value. Offer relevant products and good offers.
